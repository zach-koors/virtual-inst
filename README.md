This is a web browser-based music maker I have designed which is inspired by retro video games and Pocket Operator step sequencers.
I initially drew the design on paper, and thought through how the design would work primarily on mobile devices.
The idea came from my music making background, and I wanted to create a lightweight app using only front-end technologies.
